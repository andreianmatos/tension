These images and sounds are the result of the user tests done within the context of a Master's dissertation at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico with a goal to study the feeling and perception of visual and sonic tension in generative art.

From the various tests done on several pairs of visual and acoustic features, there were two last test which combined the total of five features explored per category, sound and image. 

These images and sounds are the answers of the sixty users who performed these tests, their choices for most and least tense image and sound.

The data used for the creation of the generative sounds and images encountered at andreianmatos.github.io/final was the analysis of the data collected from the remaining tests, that is those on the feature pairs.

We believe it to be an interesting exercise to compare these images and sounds created by the users when able to manipulate the five features with those generated from the data on each feature individually which does not account for the simultaneous interaction between the remaining four.

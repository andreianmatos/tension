            <p class="red"><b>DEFINITIONS</b></p>
            <p><b>AROUSAL: </b>A state of excitement or energy spent on an emotion. Related to the intensity of the stimulus.</p>
            <p><b>VALENCE: </b>The inate attractiveness (positive valence) or averseness (negative valence) of the stimulus.</p>
      
            <p><b>TENSION: </b>The emotional state which relates to conflict, instability or uncertainty; that creates a desire for resolution; that increases as does expectaction, anticipation, 
                which consequently holds an important place in the creation and management of dynamics in artistic practices.</p>
                
            <p>In this test, you must consider felt tension when answering, as opposed to perceived tension.</p>
            <p><b>FELT TENSION: </b>Your own subjective emotional experience.</p>
            <p><b>PERCEIVED TENSION: </b>The tension you assume the stimulus is supposed to express. </p>
            <p class="red"><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>
            <P>Each test will present to you one image or one sound repeated twice, that is, the left and right image/sound are the same.The sound test includes a button which functions like a piano key, you hover (not click!) the mouse over it to begin the sound and it will play as long as your mouse is over the button. It will stop once the mouse leaves the button.</P>
            <P>You will have to use the given sliders to manipulate the image/sound on the left to be the most tense possible and on the right to be the least tense possible. Underneath each there is a questionnaire regarding your reaction to it, namely the tension you felt. There is also a grid in which you must click on the cell that better suits your underlying emotional state when considering the image or sound.
            <P>Every time you finish a test, click on <em>Next test!</em> at the bottom of the page and another will be randomly chosen.
            At the end, you will be able to manually select any test by clicking on the test number and update your answers if you want to. If you do this, save your answers at the end of every test!</P>
